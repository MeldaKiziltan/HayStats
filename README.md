# Introducing HayStats!

Do you have to write a research paper? Or maybe prove someone wrong in an argument quickly? Or are doing a report last minute (we've never done that before... totally haven't)? Doesn't it feel like you're searching for a needle in a haystack?

HayStats is a chrome extension that extracts statistics from a webpage as well as other relevant insights including mentioned companies or people, categories, and keywords. This information is then exported so that users can view and copy the information at their leisure.

Created within 36 hours of stress, ups and downs, and lots of coffee, we'd like to present to you our Hack the North 2020++ submission!
**UPDATE**: HayStats got an honourable mention from IBM for Best up and Coming for use of IBM Cloud and their API!

## How does HayStats work?
Based on the open page of the user, HayStats leverages IBM's Nagtural Language Understanding API - better known as Watson - to check each sentence if it contains numbers or words that correspond to quantities, financial statements, and other statistics. If the sentence contains a statistic, it is appended to a list of statistics for that page, along with more page insights. This list can be accessed by the user through the notepad interface. The majority of the programming was done through Javascript, NodeJS, CSS, and HTML.

Made of a team for first and second time hackers, we are proud to present HayStats to you!

## What's the future of HayStats?
Fear not! HayStats will be improved! After pitching our idea to our fellow classmates, we realised that there is a real depand for Haystats and we plan to keep on developing this project and releasing it out to the world wid web for everyone to use!
